%h2 There are a couple of ways to start using&nbsp;SASS:

      There are a good many applications that will get you up and running
      with SASS in a few minutes for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You can download
      most of the applications for free but a few of them are paid apps
      <small>(and totally worth it)</small>.

      %dd
        If you're using a distribution of Linux, you'll need to install Ruby
        first. You can install Ruby through the apt package manager, rbenv, or rvm.
        %pre
          :preserve
            sudo su -c "gem install sass"

    %dl#install-ruby-windows
      %dt Windows
      %dd
        Before you start using SASS you will need to install Ruby. The fastest
        way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use
        <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org">Ruby Installer</a>. It's a
        single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super
        fast.

      %dd
        The installer will also install a Ruby command line
        powershell application that will let you use the Ruby libraries.

      %dl#install-ruby-mac
        %dt Mac
        %dd
          If you prefer the command line over an application then getting SASS
          set up is a fairly quick process. SASS has a Ruby dependency but if
          you're using a Mac, congratulations, Ruby comes pre-installed.

        %dt Install SASS
        %dd
          %p
            Here's the quickest way we've found to start using SASS by using
            the command line:

          %ol
            %li
              %p
                <strong>Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.</strong> On the
                Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located
                in your "Utilities" folder. On Windows, run `cmd`.

            %li
              %p
                <strong>Install SASS.</strong> Ruby uses Gems to manage its
                various packages of code like SASS. In your open terminal
                window type:
              %pre
                :preserve
                  gem install sass
              %p
                This will install SASS and any dependencies for you. It's pretty
                magical. If you get an error message then it's likely you will need to use the <code>sudo</code> command to install the SASS gem. It would look like:
              %pre
                :preserve
                  sudo gem install sass

            %li
              %p
                <strong>Double-check.</strong> You should now have SASS
                installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your
                terminal application you can type:
              %pre
                :preserve
                  sass -v
              - if data.respond_to?(:version)
                %p It should return <code>SASS #{data.version.number} (#{data.version.name})</code>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed SASS.
              - else
                %p It should return <code>SASS ???</code>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed SASS.

            %li
              %p
                <strong>Go and play.</strong> If you're brand new to SASS
                we've set up some resources to help you learn pretty darn
                quick.
