  ## SassC

  LibSass is just a library. To run the code locally (i.e. to compile your stylesheets), you need an implementer. SassC (get it?) is an implementer written in C. There are a number of other implementations of LibSass - for example Node. We encourage you to write your own port - the whole point of Libsass is that we want to bring Sass to many other languages, not just Ruby!

  To run the compiler on your local machine, you need to build SassC. To build SassC, you must have either a local copy of the libsass source or it must be installed into your system. For development, please use the source version. You must then setup an environment variable pointing to the LibSass folder, for example:

~ partial "code-snippets/libsass-setup"

%p
  The executable will be in the bin folder. To run it, simply try something like:

~ partial "code-snippets/libsass-execute"
