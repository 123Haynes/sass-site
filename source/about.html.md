title: About Sass
introduction: >
  Sass was originally developed as a feature of the Haml markup language. Since
  then, Sass has outgrown its original home as part of Haml and is now a
  thriving project, much more popular than its original host project.

## Sass Language

It was originally conceived of by [Hampton Catlin][1] in 2006, however he only
remained an active Core Team member through version 2009 and is no longer
actively developing on Sass. [Natalie Weizenbaum][2] is the primary developer
and designer of Sass and has been involved in the project since the second
commit. In 2008, [Chris Eppstein][3] joined the Sass Core Team and is also the
creator of Compass. Since joining, he and Natalie have designed Sass together
and have created most of the modern features of the language.

## Sass Website, Brand, and Design

The Sass website design and brand was brought to you largely by [Jina Anne][4],
with major contributions from Bermon Painter (who designed the logo), Michael
Parenteau, and the Sass Language Core Team.
